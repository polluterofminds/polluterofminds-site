This is not to say you never do anything for free again, and this is certainly not to say you can just up and charge people for all your creative works, even if they come from different categories.

When the book was released, people actually paid for it. Does this mean I'll never release short fiction for free? Absolutely not. But it does mean I've moved past the creating for experience phase. If I were to write a novel (which I have—twice), I would not release it for free. Many people do. Check out Wattpad. That's a great place to build and create to learn.
