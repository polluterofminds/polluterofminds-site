13:T428,Before I dive in, a little background. SimpleID was launched as a response to a shared experience my co-founders and I had in building decentralized apps. The onboarding experience was absolute shit. We had built in the Blockstack ecosystem and couldn't get real traction outside the crypto-enthusiast market because of the poor user experience around decentralized key management. So, we started building an open source solution to the Blockstack problem. However, we realized Blockstack's ecosystem was far too small to sustain anything that might turn into a real business. So, we began exploring Ethereum. Ethereum has a much larger developer population, significantly more applications, and, importantly, investment money spread out across protocols, tools, and apps. That was attractive to us, so we pivoted into an onboarding tool for developers building in the Ethereum space. It was with that pitch—give developers the tools to build onboarding experiences in the Web3 space that are as easy as Web2—that we were accepted into the Tachyon accelerator.10:[null,["$","section",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 sm:px-6 xl:max-w-5xl xl:px-0","children":[["$","$L11",null,{}],["$","article",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"xl:divide-y xl:divide-gray-200 xl:dark:divide-gray-700","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"pt-6 xl:pb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-1 text-center","children":[["$","dl",null,{"className":"space-y-10","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Published on"}],["$","dd",null,{"className":"text-base font-medium leading-6 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400","children":["$","time",null,{"dateTime":"2020-06-29T18:27:13.000Z","children":"Monday, June 29, 2020"}]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-4xl sm:leading-10 md:text-5xl md:leading-14","children":"Post Mortem on the Tachyon Startup Accelerator Experience"}]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid-rows-[auto_1fr] divide-y divide-gray-200 pb-8 dark:divide-gray-700 xl:grid xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-6 xl:divide-y-0","children":[["$","dl",null,{"className":"pb-10 pt-6 xl:border-b xl:border-gray-200 xl:pt-11 xl:dark:border-gray-700","children":[["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Authors"}],["$","dd",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4 sm:space-x-12 xl:block xl:space-x-0 xl:space-y-8","children":[["$","li","Justin Hunter",{"className":"flex items-center space-x-2","children":[["$","$L12",null,{"src":"/static/images/avatar.jpg","width":38,"height":38,"alt":"avatar","className":"h-10 w-10 rounded-full"}],["$","dl",null,{"className":"whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium leading-5","children":[["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Name"}],["$","dd",null,{"className":"text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100","children":"Justin Hunter"}],["$","dt",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"Twitter"}],["$","dd",null,{"children":["$","a",null,{"target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","href":"https://twitter.com/polluterofminds","className":"text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-600 dark:hover:text-primary-400","children":"@polluterofminds"}]}]]}]]}]]}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"divide-y divide-gray-200 dark:divide-gray-700 xl:col-span-3 xl:row-span-2 xl:pb-0","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"prose max-w-none pb-8 pt-10 dark:prose-invert","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":["As some of you now know, ",["$","a",null,{"target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","href":"https://polluterofminds.com/startups-and-difficult-decisions/","children":"I left my last start-up"}]," to help the company extend its runway and survive.

But Tachyon structured their funding in a way that was designed to help mitigate this as much as possible. The first part of the funding was available to founders right away in a stock purchase deal.

I have a family, I have a mortgage, bills, etc. They have some of those things, but they have significantly more freedom, so an idea arose.

Venture funding is, generally, in the form of equity or debt, and we did walk away with both debt and shares given out in exchange for funding, but unlike college, we had something tangible to show...money and a business."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"But I digress. The experience within the program was structured in a way that allowed us to work as autonomously as possible while still helping us learn. There were just enough interruptions every day that it quickly became clear one of our co-founders, our CTO, could not come into the office and expect to get all the technical work done for our product to succeed. So, he stopped coming, and Tachyon was totally cool with that. They want you to build a successful company. For SimpleID, we were fortunate in that we had three co-founders. My other co-founder and I stuck around, taking the train to SoHo every day and working on the customer development side of the business while attending sessions Tachyon put on for founders."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Let's talk about the sessions."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Again, Tachyon gave founders as much flexibility as possible, but they also wanted you to learn. Now, it's hard to make a program dynamic enough to address the varying levels of experience founders have, and in our cohort's case, 80% of the cohort was from outside the United States, so there were definitely ranges in knowledge around US-based business operations and startups."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"The sessions were largely good. One session might be focused on fundraising, the next might be on operational processes and legal structures. These sessions were good, if not always helpful. But the area where Tachyon really shined was their Thursday happy hours."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"The happy hour was designed around founder lessons. Tachyon would bring in founders of companies that had raised money, had seen success. These founders would talk about their experiences and then take questions from the cohort. And then, we'd all hang out in the office with the invited founders, drink beers, eat snacks, and talk shop. This is where I learned the most."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"In fact, it was in those early Thursday happy hours that I learned the best way to make our business successful was to get out and meet with customers and potential partners in a more casual way than business schools would suggest.

Instead, they have an \"Investor Day.\" In this scenario, the startups do not get up on a stage and pitch to a crowd. Instead, a bunch of investors are brought in and placed into meeting rooms. The teams then get to speed pitch the investors in a round robin format."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This experience was invaluable. I'm not sure I would have predicted that when first told of this process. I think going in, I thought a traditional demo day would be better. But what this structure did was force us all to learn how to properly take investor meetings. The compressed timeframe helped us frame our pitches. The practice we got leading up to the event made it so that when the event day came, we knew every question someone might ask us and had an answer ready."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"All that said, I still look back on Investor Day as investor meeting practice. I'm not sure if anyone walked away from that day with investment commitments. But I can promise every single company walked away better equipped to go set their own meetings and execute on those meetings."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Now, the money. As I mentioned, the first part of Tachyon's investment was a stock purchase agreement. The second, larger part, was in the form of a convertible note. I was not as excited about this as I was about an equity arrangement. In fact, my co-founders and I seriously considered rushing our fundraising effort to avoid having to take the convertible note. Having a debt instrument hang over you just felt like it would be unnecessary pressure in an environment where the pressure was already ratcheted up to 1000."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"However, to Tachyon's credit, they were very patient with my co-founders and I. They had multiple meetings with us, offered up their legal team for us to grill with questions, and generally gave us room to make a wise decision.
