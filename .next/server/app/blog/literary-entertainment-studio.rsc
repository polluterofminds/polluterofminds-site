I was fortunate to go through a program that left pretentiousness behind and was as inclusive and welcoming as an expensive graduate program can be. However, there is a distinct feeling that comes out of every MFA that the only way to make it is to be published. Professors are often judged by their publication record. And publication in a literary journal is not enough. You have to be published by, preferably, a large publishing house, and short of that, you have to be published by an independent publisher. When I graduated, I shopped my novel to multiple agents. Got a few bites, but nothing major. This was the way that things went. Take your shot, see what happens.

As a creative team, they worked to develop stories in house. They produced those stories. They distributed those stories. They productized the creative process."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"We see this in television as well. Yes, it's true that television studios might buy a pilot like Hollywood does for film scripts.
