But the role itself assumes there is a need for someone to “own” the process of assigning tasks, moving tasks, following up on tasks, and more. The reason some people may think product management is a hindrance to execution is that those people aren’t closely involved with the “dirty work” of managing the workload."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This feeling that product managers are blockers is amplified in organizations that “empower” product managers to also be product owners.

This results in everyone taking orders and executing toward some goal without understanding why."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"An even more troubling part of the lack of context is when the product manager herself doesn’t even have the context. In that scenario, there is no opportunity for involvement. Yet even when the product manager has the context, organizational design can get in the way of pushing context and involvement across the chain."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Deep-seated fallacies also block progress on this front. Engineers who have never gotten on a customer call can sometimes be hesitant to join a product manager on a call.
