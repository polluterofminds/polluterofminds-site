If not, the tl;dr is Epic Games no longer wants to pay Apple 30% of the proceeds they receive from players who purchase their in-game currency on iOS devices. Epic released an in-game payment system on iOS that bypassed Apple's payment system, and, very expectedly, they got banned. They did the same thing on Android devices, and they were subsequently banned on Android too. Epic used the bans as a springboard to file anti-trust lawsuits against both Google and Apple."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This case study is not about whether you stand with Epic, stand with Apple, or stand in the corner twiddling your thumbs. What it is is an illustration of anti-competitive practices and their impact on the web. Apple is a walled garden. There is no disputing this. It's a fact paraded around as convenience, as security, as usability. Your iOS device or iPad is not yours in the sense you cannot install whatever you want on it. You can only install what Apple says you can install."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"There is some truth in the protective qualities of a walled garden approach like this. Apple has been known for decades now for its stability and its lack of viruses. Yet, that stability and security comes at a cost. You may not be getting the best deals you can when making payments in-app for the software you use on your phone or iPad. Surely, apps tack on a percentage to whatever they would otherwise charge to help offset the fees Apple extracts. And what about those older Apple devices that are no longer supported by Apple? Those perfectly serviceable iPads lying in the junk heaps or in your junk drawers? In an open ecosystem, in the open web world, a device's age has no bearing on whether it can be used, on whether new software can be installed."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"So, take sides in the Epic vs. Apple battle if you want, but the point is not about that one particular battle.

PWAs also offer the opportunity for apps built for the web to live in your start menu or in your dock on desktops and Macs."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"As exciting as the proposition of a web app being something that can be installed like a native app is, that only scratches the surface of the potential offered by PWAs. APIs that offer near-native app access are powerful and can create an experience that is indistinguishable from native apps. Push notifications, file system access, splash screens, offline support, and more are all available through PWAs just like they are with native apps. Web apps can be distracting if for nothing more than the always-there option to open another tab. With PWAs, you can focus. With a web app that opens like a full-screen, native app, you can focus on the thing you intended to do. This benefits users, but it also benefits the app developers in that their users are less likely to leave quickly."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"The biggest benefit PWAs provide is their circumventive nature. Apple, unless they decide to entirely disregard web standards, cannot prevent PWAs from being installed on user's home screens. Apple and Google cannot levy 30% taxes on purchases made in these apps. As devices age, they can still continue to be useful with new software obtained outside the App Store and Play Store ecosystems.
