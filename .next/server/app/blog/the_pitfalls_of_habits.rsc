Keeping with the theme of working out, telling myself that every day at 7:00 am, I will work out was a good start. But I struggled with when to take days off. I tried to focus on getting a workout in at least 4 days per week, but that wasn't a strong enough commitment to build a habit. I would miss a couple of days and then it would be hard to make up the days and hit my goal."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"It wasn't until I built the habit of working out every day besides two predefined off days that the habit stuck. This applies to many things outside of working out as well. When I was learning to code, I had to build a daily habit of actually writing code in addition to watching videos and reading tutorials for the work to pay off and start to feel natural. Many years ago, I launched a sports blog. I found that the best way to generate enough content to produce ad revenue was to write multiple articles in the morning before work.

Mentally, you can prepare yourself if you know you're going to have to break an important habit.
