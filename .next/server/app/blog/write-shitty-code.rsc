What I also didn't realize is how far ahead of its time products like Dreamweaver were.

I learned HTML and CSS first, of course. I enjoyed that, but I wanted to make web pages DO things. So, I took a stab at JavaScript. I tried to learn through books at first, knowing that without the fundamentals I'd be doomed to failure. But learning to work on the web from a book often meant the content was quickly out of date. Unless the author published updates, the web just moves so fast it was hard to be sure the techniques in the book were still applicable. So, I transitioned to YouTube videos. I got further, but I was stuck in this rut where the fundamentals were incredibly boring without some form of practical application. Sure, a variable is cool and all, but how the hell do I use it to make my website do X? A for loop seems awesome, but when do I get to make it do something other than count?"}],["$","p",null,{"children":["I'm sure I'm not alone in these feelings.

In enrolled in an MFA program in Creative Writing and wrote countless stories and even a couple novels. All of that writing was stored in Google Docs. I loved the convenience of the technology when compared to the antiquated patterns my classmates followed. Save to Word. Email copy to themselves. Fetch email and download document.

Google tells me I am, right? But the truth is, Google could lock me out anytime they wanted. They could tell me I had violated their Terms of Service, and they were under no obligation to tell me specifically how I violated them, and they were under no obligation to provide me any sort of hearing or arbitration process.

No. Is that a wonderful way to finally get over the coding hurdle, ship an app, and learn? Hell yeah, it is."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Fundamentals are important, but I'm convinced that if you are hitting a wall in your coding journey you should just ship something. Take a course that gets you from point A to B. Ship an app. Learn to improve it after you've built it. For many people, learning the basics without a tangible application of those basics is fine.
