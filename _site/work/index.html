      <p>Write/Sprint is a native iOS app built to help writers track their progress. It's as simple as setting the writing sprint length, clicking start, then recording the number of words you wrote in the session.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: Write/Sprint was my first ever SwiftUI app.</p>

      <h3><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://graphitedocs.com">Graphite</a></h3>
      <p>Graphite was a privacy-focused alternative to Google Docs. It was built in 2017, launched in 2018, and shut down in 2020.</p>
      <p>The app was the first app I'd ever built. It was the reason I learned to code. It was also led to my first real money made online.</p>
