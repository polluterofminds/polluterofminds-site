The difference, though, is in the mechanism for testing assumptions. If you make a decision based on an assumption, you're making a bet. But you have to test that bet. You have to be willing to validate that bet through customer research. When people ask you for decisions on the spot, they often expect you to be the expert and the voice of the customer. It's a good position to be in, but it can also be a trap.\n\nIf you find yourself going with your gut too often, you might be guessing. And product management is not guessing. Product management is research. It's empathy and analysis. You will develop some gut feels, and you should leverage those for quick wins.
