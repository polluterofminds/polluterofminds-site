    "raw": "Today is my first day as a full-time employee in well over a year. It's a weird feeling, but I'm excited, so let me trace the path here and explain why I'm joining [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud) as a Fullstack Engineer.\n\nIn April of 2019 I said goodbye to the stability of full-time employment to put all my effort into [Graphite](https://graphitedocs.com)—a project I had started two years prior. Unfortunately, Graphite almost immediately fizzled. I didn't officially shut Graphite down until a few months ago. After Graphite began to fizzle, a new opportunity presented itself and I co-founded [SimpleID](https://simpleid.xyz). SimpleID found enough traction to be accepted into the Consensys accelerator, Tachyon.\n\nThen COVID hit.\n\nSimpleID was struggling to raise its seed round and [I felt it best to free up capital for my other co-founders by stepping away](https://polluterofminds.com/startups-and-difficult-decisions/). When I made that decision, I knew I wasn't going to jump straight back into regular employment, so I began contracting. During that process, I started contracting for Pinata, among other companies. Soon, I found myself enjoying it so much that I was contracting exclusively for Pinata with the goal of transitioning to full-time employment.\n\nAnd that's where we're at today. I can finally announce my official position with Pinata.\n\n### Why Pinata\n\nI've known Matt and Kyle, the founders, for a few years now. In fact, Pinata provided the infrastructure to power some of Graphite's more cutting-edge experiments. I've been a big fan of IPFS since I first heard about it, and Pinata's name has grown synonymous with IPFS. If you think pinning, you think Pinata.\n\nWhen Matt heard I was contracting, he talked to me about working together. This coincided with Filecoin's ramp up toward its mainnet launch. I was fortunate to work on the core Pinata product while building brand new functionality on a brand new technology.\n\nThe future for Pinata is incredibly bright. It's led by two smart people, has the respect of an entire industry, and has proven itself patient and calculating—two traits I favor in a company.\n\nI'm excited for what the future holds, and if you're interested in building on top of IPFS or Filecoin, I'd love to help you.
