# Now

This is a page dedicated to what I'm working on right now. It's never supposed to go stale. So if it does, kick me. 

I'm currently working on: 
* [Write/Sprint](https://getwritesprint.com)
* a grant project called [Hamlet](https://gitlab.com/polluterofminds/hamlet) 
* a desktop writing app
* My book, The Impostor's Guide To Learning How To Code

Think I should be working on something else? Want to work with me? [Let me know](https://twitter.com/polluterofminds).
